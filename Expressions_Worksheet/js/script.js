//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

//Givens:
//Sparky’s age.

//Result Variable: Sparky’s age in dog years.


//Result to Print: “Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.

var humanYears = 4;             //This is Sparkies age in human years. (I gave him this age since it wasn't told to us)
var dogYears = humanYears * 7;  //We were told that each year for a human is seven years for a dog.  So humanYears x 7 will give us the product.
console.log("Sparky is " + dogYears + " years old.");          //This prints out "Sparky is 28 years old."
